### Load Data
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
house <- read_csv("../Source/house_TC.csv")
```


### Variable Names
```{r}
names(house)
```


### Treat Time = 0
```{r}
# Note: Only 1 case has `tom` = 0. Fix this value to 1.
house <- house %>% mutate(tom = ifelse(tom == 0, 1, tom))
```


## With only `tom`
### Graphs: Exponential - density, CDF, and survival curve
```{r}
survreg( Surv(tom) ~ 1 , dist = "exponential" , data = house )
```

```{r}
# Density
house %>% ggplot(aes(x=tom)) + 
  stat_function( fun=dexp, args= 1/exp(4.454011)) + 
  labs(title = "Exponential PDF for Time on Market", x="Time on Market", y="Density",
       caption = "Data collected from Coldwell Banker")

# CDF
house %>% ggplot(aes(x=tom)) + 
  stat_function(fun=pexp, args= 1/exp(4.454011)) + 
  labs(title = "Exponential CDF for Time on Market", x="Time on Market", y="Cumulative Proportion",
       caption = "Data collected from Coldwell Banker")

# Survival
house %>% ggplot(aes(x=tom)) + 
  stat_function(fun=pexp, args= 1/exp(4.454011), lower.tail=FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Exponential Survival Curve for Time on Market", x="Time on Market", y="Survival Proportion",
       caption = "Data collected from Coldwell Banker")
```

## With some variables
### Graphs: Exponential - density, CDF, and survival curve
```{r}
# (sreg <- survreg( Surv(tom) ~ zip + beds + bathf + bathp + carg + sqft + listedatpr + soldatpr + listedatdate + soldatdate + neighb + schdist + ncrime + prdiff + prdiff_perc + prdiff_np , dist = "exponential" , data = house ))

(sreg <- survreg( Surv(tom) ~ prdiff_np + prdiff_perc + sqft + schdist, dist = "exponential" , data = house ))
```


### Graphs: Weibull - density, CDF, and survival curve
```{r}
survreg( Surv(tom) ~ 1 , dist = "weibull" , data = house )
```

```{r}
# Density
house %>% ggplot(aes(x=tom)) + 
  stat_function( fun=dweibull, args=list(shape=1/0.5511901, scale=exp(4.575712))) + 
  labs(title = "Weibull PDF for Time on Market", x="Time on Market", y="Density",
       caption = "Data collected from Coldwell Banker")

# CDF
house %>% ggplot(aes(x=tom)) + 
  stat_function(fun=pweibull, args=list(shape=1/0.5511901, scale=exp(4.575712))) + 
  labs(title = "Weibull CDF for Time on Market", x="Time on Market", y="Cumulative Proportion",
       caption = "Data collected from Coldwell Banker")

# Survival
house %>% ggplot(aes(x=tom)) + 
  stat_function(fun=pweibull, args=list(shape=1/0.5511901, scale=exp(4.575712)), lower.tail=FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Weibull Survival Curve for Time on Market", x="Time on Market", y="Survival Proportion",
       caption = "Data collected from Coldwell Banker")
```


### Chance that the house will be on the market for more than 50 days
```{r}
# Exponential
1-pexp(50, 1/exp(4.454011))

# Weibull
1-pweibull(50, shape=1/0.5511901, scale=exp(4.575712))
```


### Mean time to sell
```{r}
# Exponential
S = function(x) 1-pexp(x, 1/exp(4.454011))
integrate(S,0,Inf)

# Weibull
S = function(x) 1-pweibull(x, shape=1/0.5511901, scale=exp(4.575712))
integrate(S,0,Inf)
```


### Median time to sell
```{r}
qexp(0.5, 1/exp(4.454011))
qweibull(0.5, shape=1/0.5511901, scale=exp(4.575712))
```


## Kaplan-Meier curves

### Kaplan-Meier curves with CI - all groups
```{r}
KM = survfit( Surv(tom) ~ 1 , conf.type="plain" , data=house ) 
ggsurvplot(KM, data=house) +
  labs(x = "Days on Market", y = "Survival Probability", title = "Kaplan-Meier Curve of Days on Market",
       caption = "Data collected from Coldwell Banker")
```


### Kaplan-Meier curves with CI - by price difference groups
```{r}
# Note: Price Difference = sold - listed
KMECDF = survfit(Surv(tom) ~ prdiff_np, conf.type="plain" , data=house )
ggsurvplot(KMECDF, data=house, conf.int = TRUE, legend.title="Type", 
           legend.labs=c("Positive Price Difference","Negative Price Difference", "No Price Difference")) +
    labs(x = "Days on Market", y = "Survival Probability", title = "Kaplan-Meier Curve of Days on Market",
       caption = "Data collected from Coldwell Banker")
# without conf inf
ggsurvplot(KMECDF, data=house, legend.title="Type", 
           legend.labs=c("Positive Price Difference","Negative Price Difference", "No Price Difference")) +
    labs(x = "Days on Market", y = "Survival Probability", title = "Kaplan-Meier Curve of Days on Market",
       caption = "Data collected from Coldwell Banker")
```

### Inspect Confidence Interval for Each Group

#### 30-day survival probability


** Price difference positive ** 

Note: positive = sold at > listed at, indicating high demand (hot market)

* Point Estimate of one-month (30 days) survival probability: 0.9012
* Interval Estimate of one-month (30 days) survival probability: [0.83855, 0.9686]

It's a hot market, and thus, the houses sell fast.

** Price difference negative **

Note: negative = sold at < listed at, indicating low demand (cold market)

* Point Estimate of one-month (30 days) survival probability: 0.97409 
* Interval Estimate of one-month (30 days) survival probability: [0.951937, 0.9968]

More likely to be on the market longer than price difference positive condition, which makes sense since the market is cold. Narrower confidence interval as well compared to the hot market.


** Price difference none **

* Point Estimate of one-month (30 days) survival probability: 0.8919  
* Interval Estimate of one-month (30 days) survival probability: [0.79725, 0.998]

Much larger confidence interval but this may be because there aren't many houses that did not change in price in the market. The point estimate is definitely slightly lower as well compared top the hot market, meaning that it sells quite faster than the cold market but not as fast as the hot market. However, as mentioned previously, the large CI makes it unreliable.

<br>

#### Point estimate and the 95% CI for the time when the survival curve drops to 0.80.

** Price difference positive ** 

* The point estimate for when S(k) = 0.50 is 37, and the CI is: [32, 41]

HERE!!!
** Price difference negative ** 


#### Median survival and C.I.

**The point estimate for when S(k) = 0.50 is 48, and the CI is: [42, 53].**


```{r}
summary(KMECDF)
```


### KM Median 
```{r}
# median for all groups
KM

# median by price difference groups
KMECDF
```

### KM Mean Survival
```{r}
# Finds area under Kaplan-Meier curve (if largest observation is censored, this assumes that the K-M drops to 0 at that value).

# AUCKM stands for "Area Under Curve Kaplan Meier":
AUCKM = function(survobj,duration)
{
base=c(0,summary(survobj)$time,max(duration))
heights=c(1,summary(survobj)$surv)
new=c()
for(i in 1:length(heights)) { new=c(new,(base[i+1]-base[i])*heights[i]) }
c(sum(new))
}

# mean survival for all groups
AUCKM(KM, house$tom)

# mean survival by price difference groups
AUCKM(KMECDF, house$tom)
```


## Actuarial Method Estimate

### Life Table Function 
```{r}
LifeTable = function( time, status, breaks, finite ) {
  failed = c(0,hist(time[status==1],breaks=breaks,plot=F)$counts)
  censored = c(0,hist(time[status==0],breaks=breaks,plot=F)$counts)
  alivestart = length(time)-cumsum(failed[-length(failed)])-cumsum(censored[-length(censored)])
  atrisk = alivestart-c(censored[-1]/2)
  failrate = failed[-1]/atrisk
  survrate = 1-failrate
  survest = c(1,cumprod(1-failrate)[1:(length(failrate))])
  if (finite == 0) 
    return(as.data.frame(cbind(Failed = failed[-1], Censored=censored[-1], AliveStart=alivestart,
                             AtRisk = atrisk[-length(atrisk)], FailRate = failrate[-length(failrate)],
                SurvRate = survrate[-length(survrate)], SurvEst = survest[-length(survest)])))
  if (finite == 1) 
    return(as.data.frame(cbind(Failed = failed[-1], Censored = censored[-1], AliveStart = alivestart, 
                               AtRisk = atrisk, FailRate = failrate, SurvRate = survrate, SurvEst = survest))) }
```

### Plot Survival Estimates from Life Table
```{r}
status <- rep(1, 311)
b = c( 0 , 25 , 50 , 75 , 100 , 125 , 150 , 175 , 200 , 225 , 250 , 300 , 325 , 350, 375)
(l = LifeTable(house$tom, status, breaks=b, finite=1))
# !!! number of rows of result is not a multiple of vector length (arg 1)

step = stepfun( c(25,50,75,100,125,150,175,200,225 , 250 , 300 , 325 , 350, 375) , l$SurvEst )
plot( step , do.points=FALSE , ylab="Survival" , xlab="Months" , main="")
```

#### Plot KM & Actuarial method estimate for Comparison
```{r}
# ggplot!!! both plots
# KM = survfit( Surv(tom) ~ 1 , conf.type="plain" , data=house ) 
# ggsurvplot(KM, data=house) +
#   labs(x = "Days on Market", y = "Survival Probability", title = "Kaplan-Meier Curve of Days on Market",
#        caption = "Data collected from Coldwell Banker")

plot(KM, ylab="Survival" , xlab="Days" , main="House Survival")
plot( step , do.points=FALSE, add=TRUE, col = "red")
```

### Actuarial estimate of the hazard function
```{r}
HazardEst = l$FailRate/25
hazstep = stepfun( c(0,25,50,75,100,125,150,175,200,225,250,300,325,350,375,400) , c(0,HazardEst,0) )
plot( hazstep, do.points=FALSE, ylab="h(k)", xlab="k", main="", xlim=c(0,225) )
```



### Plot Weibull: Compare estimated hazard and survival functions to those obtained via the actuarial method
```{r}
(weib <- survreg( Surv(tom) ~ 1 , dist='weibull' , data=house))
```

#### We can add the estimated Weibull hazard to the graph of the piecewise constant actuarial hazard estimate:

```{r}
plot(hazstep,do.points=FALSE,ylab='h(k)',xlab='k',main="",xlim=c(0,225))
curve(dweibull(x, shape=1/0.5511901, scale=exp(4.575712)) / (1-pweibull(x, shape=1/0.5511901, scale=exp(4.575712))), add=T, col='red')
```

```{r}
g = ggplot(data=data.frame(x=c(-1, 0,25,50,75,100,125,150,175,200,225,250,300,325,350,375,400),
                       y=c(0,HazardEst,0)) , aes(x=x,y=y)) +
  geom_step() +
  labs(x='k',y='h(k)')

hweibull = function(x,shape,scale) { dweibull(x,shape=shape,scale=scale)/(1-pweibull(x,shape=shape,scale=scale)) }

g + stat_function(fun=hweibull,args=list(shape=1/0.5511901, scale=exp(4.575712)) , col='red') 
```


## Hazard Functions

### Exponential
```{r}
hexp = function(x,lambda) { dexp(x,lambda) / ( 1-pexp(x,lambda) ) }
```

```{r}
curve( hexp( x , 1/exp(4.454011) ) , from=0 , to=max(house$tom) , ylim = c(0,0.02), col = "red")
```


### Weibull
```{r}
hweibull = function(x, a, b) { dweibull(x, a, b) / ( 1-pweibull(x, a, b) ) }
```

```{r}
curve( hweibull( x , 1/0.5511901, exp(4.575712)) , from=0 , to=max(house$tom) , ylim = c(0,0.06), col = "red")
```
